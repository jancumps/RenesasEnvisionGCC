This demonstration shows how to use FreeRTOS on the Envision kit.

This uses the FreeRTOS port layer for the RXv2 architecture available
on the FreeRTOS website.

Three tasks are created and 2 are synchronized with semaphores. The tasks
do not do anything but can be seen to run in the e2studio debugger.

This is not a professional tested port of FreeRTOS to the Envision Kit
or RX65N processor. Do not use in production code.
